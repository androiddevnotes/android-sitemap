**Android Sitemap** aims to be your starting point to find every link pointing to Android Developer sites: [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/) and [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/).

The repo was created to see the full scope of Android documentation guides and reference APIs. Some gems like [API diff](sdk.md), [Android Open Source Project reference APIs](source-reference.md) were discovered in the process which I find very interesting.

The repo contains only links and no meta information like Title, Description for now as there are 50000+ links.

The content is generated from [here](https://developer.android.com/sitemap.xml) and [here.](https://source.android.com/sitemap.xml)

## [Compatibility](compatibility.md)

- About: Design an Android Device.

  - Being open source, Android offers a near-infinite combination of hardware and software for you to develop devices undreamt by even the operating system's creators.

  Still, for your users to have a coherent experience as they adopt additional Android devices, consider following established standards while designing and customizing your implementation.

- Link Count: 581

- [**See all links**](compatibility.md)

## [Devices](devices.md)

- About: Develop an Android Device.

  - As an open source operating system, Android offers device and chip manufacturers [hardware abstraction layers (HALs)](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture) to be implemented as interfaces for common mobile OS functions.

  These HALs now come in the even more portable and persistent [HAL interface definition language (HIDL)](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/hidl). HIDL enables the framework to be replaced without rebuilding the HALs.

- [**See all links**](devices.md)

## [Setup](setup.md)

- About: Set up for Android Development.

  - Android is an open source software stack created for a wide array of devices with different form factors. Android's primary purpose is to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality and to introduce a successful, real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users.

  Android is designed so that there's no central point of failure, where one industry player restricts or controls the innovations of another. The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.

## [Security](source-security.md)

- About: Secure an Android Device.

  - Android incorporates industry-leading security features and works with developers and device implementers to keep the Android platform and ecosystem safe. A robust security model is essential to enable a vigorous ecosystem of apps and devices built on and around the Android platform and supported by cloud services. As a result, through its entire development lifecycle, Android has been subject to a rigorous security program.
